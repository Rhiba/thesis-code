## Usage
This code is an example implementation of the methods in Chapter 5 of this thesis. The `train.py` file shows how we can train a network using concrete dropout (the MCD inference method specified in the thesis). The `run.py` file shows how we can use uncertainty information at runtime to provide warnings to the human decision maker.
